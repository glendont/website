The end-product is a full-stack dashboard which allows cybersecurity practitioners to provide key inputs in order to generate recommendations on cybersecurity remediation. As a proof of concept, open-source datasets provided by the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) was used to train our machine learning model..",

The latent features are then clustered using the K-Nearest-Neighbors (KNN) algorithms in order to generate the more similar data points. The machine learning model is encapsulated into a back-end API using the Django web development framework. When used in conjunction with a front-end user interface, it allows users to input key characteristics of their company, and get competitor companies returned to them.",
